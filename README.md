- 👋 Hi, I’m Daz
- 🧪 I’m interested in testing APIs (well, it's part of my day job too actually!)
- 💻 I'm also starting off as a full stack web developer but still early days
- 🚀 I have experience of using Postman (to aid my day job) and am currently in a full stack web dev bootcamp
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on testing projects but also anyone learning web development
- 📚 If you are learning all about the likes of css/scss, javascript, java, libraries and databases then I'd be happy to hear from you
- 📫 You're welcome to send me a message via github to reach out
